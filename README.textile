h1. Minecraft Architect

Minecraft Architect helps you building complex structures in "minecraft":http://www.minecraft.net.
As everyone familiar to the game knows, building interesting constructions like spheres, ellipses or arcs is a very
challenging task.

This tool will simplify the process by taking away the annoying counting blocks action. Instead, you will see your actual
construction sliced by levels and your current position in a running minecraft client.

h1. Download and Installation

 * "mc_architect.jar Runnable jar file":http://mc.funky-clan.de/mc_architect.jar (~ 1.6mb)
 * "Dependency file for mc_architect.jar":http://mc.funky-clan.de/jruby-complete-1.5.2.jar (~ 11mb)

 To start Minecraft Architect, copy mc_architect.jar and the jruby.jar into any directory:
<pre><code>
  > java -jar mc_architect.jar
</code></pre>

 In the upper textbox type the name of the multiplayer server.

 Then start Minecraft and connect to a multiplayer game using <pre>localhost:12345</pre>.

h1. Scripting

For simplicity there is no 3d rasterization unit, but you are forced to "program" your structure using a simple ruby script.

<pre><code>
  java_import "de.funky_clan.mc.config.DataValues"

  profile = <<EOP
    XXXX
    X  X
    X  X
    XXXX
  EOP

  profile.split("\n").each_with_index do |line, slice|
    line.chars.each_with_index do |char, index|
      next if char==" "
      @slice_z.ellipse 10, 10, slice, 20-index, 15-index, DataValues::STATIONARYLAVA.id
    end
  end
</code></pre>

Which will generate an elliptic ring with a squarish profile.

h1. Development environment
