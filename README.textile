Minecraft Architect helps you building complex structures in "minecraft":http://www.minecraft.net.
As everyone familiar to the game knows, building interesting constructions like spheres, ellipses or arcs is a very
challenging task.

This tool will simplify the process by taking away the annoying counting blocks action. Instead, you will see your actual
construction sliced by levels and your current position in a running minecraft client.

For simplicity there is no 3d rasterization unit, but you are forced to "program" your structure using a simple ruby script.

<pre><code>
  config.create 187, 155, 2
  config.ellipse 93, 77, 93, 77, 0
  config.image "floor.png", 0

  config.ellipse 93, 77, 92, 76, 1
  config.image "level1.png", 1
</code></pre>

Of course you may use the full power of ruby:

<pre><code>
  profile = <<EOP
    XXXX
    X  X
    X  X
    XXXX
  EOP

  profile.split("\n").each_with_index do |line, level|
    line.chars.each_with_index do |char, index|
      config.ellipse 10, 10, 20-index, 15-index, level
    end
  end
</code></pre>

Which will generate an elliptic ring with a squarish profile.
